#Programming exercises done as a part of a course on Computer Architecture. programming exercises come random practice problems found online. Organised alphabetically, this list explains what each MIPS code file does.

* **add_subtract**: Input two numbers and display their sum and difference
* **bubble_sort**: implement bubble sort using a given C code as template. [incomplete]
* **capillary_raise**: Given the value of Sigma, Gamma and the cosine of angle between the glass and water, calculate the height of the capillary rise in the tube. Calculations done using formula: H = (2 *σ* cosx) / (γ * R), where we assume σ =5.670373, γ= 9.807
* **factorial**: Calculate the factorial of inputted number iteratively.
* **factorial_recursive**: Implement a recursive factorial function.
* **fp_io**: basic floating point arithmetic and manipulation.
* **hello_world**: Print hello world, input an integer and print it back onto console.
* **max_min**: Find Minimum and maximum values of array.
* **mul_div_fp**: multiply and divide numbers.
* **odd_even**: check if integer is even or odd.
* **palindrome**: check is user inputted string is palindrome
* **print_array**: print an array to console.
* **print_multiples**: Write MIPS Assembly code to print all the multiples of the given number between 0 and 100. Your program should allow the user to give the input number.
* **print_fibonacci**: Write a recursive MIPS assembly program to print the nth number of Fibonacci sequence.
* **print_pyramid**: Print a pyramid of height 'n' (user input)
* **print_shapes**: Write a program that asks if the user wants a triangle or a square. It then asks the user for the size of the object (the number of lines it takes to draw the object). The program then writes a triangle or a square of stars to the console.
* **remove_vowels**: Write a function to count the number of vowels in a given string and also return the string after removing the vowels and print that string in main function.
* **reverse_string**: reverse a user inputted string in place and print it.
* **string_length**: find length of string stored in data segment.
* **test**: disassembly exercises.
